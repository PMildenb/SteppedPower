```

# general

* Nicer names needed !!

## compare_designs

* add non-normal outcomes

## wlsMixedPower

* options to adjust for degrees of freedom (between-within, containment, none, ... )
* rewrite the very heart of the calculation as a function in sigma (using optim or similar)
* add random trt eff. Possibly just by manipulating vector tau.
* are all the function arguments needed ???

## optFunction

* does not work for parallel designs! but why ??  **done**

## non-normal-wrapper

* add design selection option **DONE**

## construct_CovMat

  * should it return a list of three elements?
    * matrix
    * timepoints
    * SumCl
  * NAMING THINGS IS HARD !! 

## simulation

  * dependencies aufraeumen
    * MATRIX and stats both? maybe load only needed functions?
    * what about `car` ? needed only for `logit()`?
  * normal case ? 
  * poisson ?
  * cohort studies



## TALKING POINTS for ISCB

* advise to use rand trt effect in literature (Hughes 2015 Thompson 2017 ... )
* inflated test size (esp. for smaller number of clusters)
* try to find balance 
* maybe hinting at GEE approaches?
* Visualisations of cluster influences ->
