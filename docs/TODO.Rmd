```

# general

* remove any sign of that stupid idea of samp size calculation!

## compare_designs

* add non-normal outcomes

## wlsMixedPower

* options to adjust for degrees of freedom (between-within, ... )

* rewrite the very heart of the calculation as a function in sigma (using optim or similar)

## non-normal-wrapper

* add design selection option

## simulation

* dependencies aufraeumen


## TAKING POINTS for ISCB

* advise to use rand trt effect (Hughes 2015 Thompson 2017 ... )
* inflated test size (esp. for smaller number of clusters)
* try to find balance 
* maybe hinting at GEE approaches?
