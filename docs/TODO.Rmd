# general

* remove any sign of that stupid idea of samp size calculation! **DONE**
* Nicer names needed !!

## compare_designs

* add non-normal outcomes

## wlsMixedPower

* options to adjust for degrees of freedom (between-within, ... )
* rewrite the very heart of the calculation as a function in sigma (using optim or similar)
* add random trt eff. Possibly just by manipulating vector tau.
* are all the function argument needed ???

## optFunction

* does not work for parallel designs! but why ??

## non-normal-wrapper

* add design selection option **DONE**

## simulation

  * dependencies aufraeumen
    * MATRIX and stats both? 
    * what about `car` ? needed only for `logit()`?


## TALKING POINTS for ISCB

* advise to use rand trt effect in literature (Hughes 2015 Thompson 2017 ... )
* inflated test size (esp. for smaller number of clusters)
* try to find balance 
* maybe hinting at GEE approaches?
* Visualisations of cluster influences ->
