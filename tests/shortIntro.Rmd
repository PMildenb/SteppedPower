## What?

* `SteppedPower` calculates power for longitudinal intervention studies
* offers tools for visualization of cluster influences
* applicable to various designs:
    + stepped wedge
    + parallel
    + parallel with baseline
    + t.b.c. 



## Why?

Software for power calculation of SWD already exists (in R: `swCRTdesign`, `SWSamp`;  in Stata: `steppedwedge`).
So why yet another new package?

* 
* constructs exact covariance matrix for non-normal responses
* convenient option to compare power of a SWD to other designs 
* integrates 

## How?

Calculate power of a z-test 

$$ \text{power} = \Phi\left(\frac{\theta_A-\theta_0}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(\hat \theta)}}- Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right) $$ 


where $\text{Var}(\hat \theta)$ depends on the design matrix and the covariance matrix.

## Design Matrix

```{r}
library(SteppedPower)
SteppedPower::construct_DesMat(Cl=c(1,1),design="SWD")
SteppedPower::construct_DesMat(Cl=c(1,1),design="parallel",timepoints=3)
```

## TODO

... a lot.


* add edge cases of SWD, e.g. incomplete designs
* add mixtures of SWD and parallel designs
* find (and implement) visualizations for the robustness against misspecification
* ...
