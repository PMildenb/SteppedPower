Description: SteppedPower offers options for power calculation as well 
    as sample size calculation (by the use of uniroot() ) for 
    longitudinal mixed model settings with up to two levels of clustering.
    All calculations are oracle estimates i.e. assume random effect variances 
    to be known (or guessed) in advance.
